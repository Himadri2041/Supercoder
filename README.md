## Implementation Assumptions & Decisions

1. **State Management**
   - Only **GetX** is used.
   - Controllers manage logic, Views handle rendering.

2. **Architecture**
   - Controllers expose reactive variables (`Rx<Type>`) observed in Views using `Obx`.

3. **Permissions**
   - Android permissions handled via **native code** (Kotlin + Manifest).
   - iOS permission handling  added

4. **Reusable Components**
   - `PrimaryButton` and `InputField` abstracted for consistency.

5. **Routing**
   - Centralized route management in `app_routes.dart`.

6. **Extra Points**
   - Animation is added.
